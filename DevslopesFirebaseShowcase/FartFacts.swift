  "The average human toots about 700ml of flatus daily—enough to blow up a birthday balloon!",
  "The average human being farts 14 times a day.",
  "Flatulence—which occurs in nearly all living organisms—is a mixture of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and in some cases, methane. These gases are produced as the byproduct of the trillions of bacteria that break down food during the digestive process.",
  "Farts can be measured using a “rectal catheter,” researchers are able to shove a tube up a patient’s poop chute to determine the volume of gas that is produced during the sacred act of farting.",
  "Farts exit the anus and enter the world at a speed of 10 feet per second, or slightly less than seven miles per hour.",
  "Truth be told, only 1% or less of the gas in your average, everyday, run-of-the-mill fart has any odor whatsoever. The main culprit is hydrogen sulfide, which generates those rancid “rotten egg” notes that make farts the bane of the world’s nostrils.",
  "Sure, there’s a certain breed of male idiot who thinks it’s funny to fart in front of others, and to be fair, women don’t tend to be afflicted with that special strain of sadism. But before they start getting all high and mighty, they should realize that female farts have a higher hydrogen sulfide concentration than male ones and thus, fart-for-fart, they’re smellier than men's farts.",
  "The word “fart” is considered a “vulgarism” and—just like farting itself—is not recommended for use in polite company. The polite noun is “flatus,” even though almost no one uses it. The word “fart” is said to have been coined in 1632 and defined as “to send forth wind from the anus.” “fart” is derived from the Old English word “feortan,” which means “to break wind.”",
  "Roman Emperor Claudius declared that “all Roman citizens should be allowed to pass gas whenever necessary,” which is an ancient variant of the modern maxim, “Wherever you be, let the wind blow free.” The ancient Japanese were said to have held “farting contests” to see who could break wind the loudest and longest. The Greek physician Hippocrates decreed that “Passing gas is necessary to well-being.”",
  "Professor Paul McDonald of the University of Wolverhampton tags a Sumerian joke from 1900 BC as the world’s oldest recorded one-liner. The joke: “Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband’s lap.“",
  "Literary luminaries who mentioned farting include William Shakespeare (flatulence is mentioned five times in his plays), Jonathan Swift (who penned a 1722 essay titled “The Benefit of Farting Explain’d”), Geoffrey Chaucer (whose Canterbury Tales include a line about a man who “let fly a fart as loud as it had been a thunder-clap”), Dante Alighieri (whose Inferno mentions a demon who used “his ass as a trumpet”), and Founding Father Ben Franklin, who wrote a whole essay titled “Fart Proudly.”",
  "Adolf Hitler suffered from hepatitis and gastrointestinal cramps, which led to a condition of chronic flatulence for which he took 28 different medications. It is almost certain that no one complained to Hitler about the smell.",
  "A Frenchman named Christian Poincheval became disgusted at a dinner party with friends: “Our farts were so smelly we were nearly suffocated. Something had to be done.” Rather than whine, the proactive, fart-fighting inventor developed a pill that renders human flatulence as sweet as roses or as seductive as chocolate.",
  "Natural, earth-borne substances that diminish the brunt force of flatulence include peppermint, ginger, yogurt, pumpkin, cardamom, and fennel.",
  "Due to cabin pressure, more intestinal gas builds up while on an airplane than when one’s feet are firmly planted on terra firma. What’s worse, the fact that 50% of cabin air is recirculated means that those stinkers will linger longer than normal.",
  "It’s impossible to fart in the deep blue sea. Underwater pressure at depths of 33 or more feet below sea level digestive gas ceases to form bubbles and instead festers inside the scuba diver’s colon.",
  "The Yanomami tribe who inhabit the Amazonian rain forest traditionally greet one another with a loud, friendly blast of anal gas.",
  "A legendary French performer known as “Le Pétomane”—which roughly translates as “Fartomaniac”—dazzled audiences at Le Moulin Rouge by using his anus to emulate “sound effects of cannon fire and thunderstorms” as well as playing songs on “an ocarina through a rubber tube in his anus.”",
  "Both methane and hydrogen are flammable—so flammable, in fact, that a shed crammed with 90 farting cows caught fire on a German dairy farm in 2014.",
  "According to researchers at Exeter University, sniffing tiny amounts of hydrogen sulfide—the precise gas that makes farts stink—can reverse mitochondrial damage and help avert strokes, dementia, cancer, and heart attacks.",
  "The reason why your own farts don’t smell as bad to you as everyone else’s: It’s the same reason that you don’t realize your house stinks of your own dog or that you can’t smell the rotting hamburger meat that’s been stuck behind your refrigerator for two months—because you’ve become used to it. One becomes “habituated” to the stinks and odors and aromas that one’s own body generates and is thus not as immediately offended as one would be by the stench of others.",
    "“Professional Fart Smeller” is a job in China. These smart fellers make up to $50,000 a year by diagnosing digestive illnesses merely through the scent of the patient’s flatulence."
